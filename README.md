# TensorFlow-Basics

This GitHub repo is a collection of iPython Notebooks that I have used to learn TensorFlow and deep learning. 
The notebooks have a number showing the order in which (if someone wants to follow and learn) it should be read.

For any issues or suggestions, please feel free to contact at soutikc@uw.edu
